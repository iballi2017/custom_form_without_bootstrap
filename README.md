# custom_form_without_bootstrap

I always have problems editing bootstrap form template components e.g text-inputs, checkboxes and radio buttons. So I decided to create a my own custom form components I would always look back on when the need arise.

This is a custom form template.

My intention was to create a form template that will have components which will be useful for me in my future projects.

This mini-project focuses on the folowing: 1. text inputs 2. checkboxes
3 radio buttons 4. buttons

Other useful components might be added later in the future
